.Sh XML PROPERTY LIST KEYS
The follow keys can be used to describe the configuration details of your daemon or agent.
.Pp
.Bl -ohang
.It Sy Label <string>
This required key uniquely identifies the job to
.Nm launchd .
.It Sy Disabled <boolean>
This optional key is used to disable your job. The default is false.
.It Sy Enabled <boolean>
This optional key is used to disable your job. The default is true.
.It Sy UserName <string>
This optional key specifies the user to run the job as. The default is the user who submitted the job to
.Nm launchd .
.It Sy UID <integer>
This optional key specifies the user ID to run the job as. The default is the user who submitted the job to
.Nm launchd .
.It Sy GroupName <string>
This optional key specifies the user to run the job as. The default is the group of the user who submitted the job to
.Nm launchd .
.It Sy GID <integer>
This optional key specifies the group ID to run the job as. The default is the group ID of the user who submitted the job to
.Nm launchd .
.It Sy inetdCompatWait <boolean>
The presense of this key specifies that the daemon expects to be run as if it were launched from
.Xr inetd 8 .
If the value is true, then the daemon will be run in "wait" mode, otherwise "nowait" mode.
.It Sy ProgramArguments <array of strings>
This required key maps to the second argument of
.Xr execvp 3 .
.It Sy Program <string>
This optional key maps to the first argument of
.Xr execvp 3 .
If this key is missing, then the first element of the array of strings provided to the ProgramArguments will be used instead.
.It Sy OnDemand <boolean>
This optional key is used to control whether your job is launched based on demand or to be kept continuously running. The default is true.
.It Sy Batch <boolean>
This optional key is used as a hint to the system. The default is false.
.It Sy RootDirectory <string>
This optional key is used to specific a directory to
.Xr chroot 2
to before running the job.
.It Sy WorkingDirectory <string>
This optional key is used to specific a directory to
.Xr chdir 2
to before running the job.
.It Sy ServiceDescription <string>
This optional key is used to specify a human readable description of the purpose of the job.
.It Sy EnvironmentVariables <dictionary of strings>
This optional key is used to specify additional environmental variables to be setup before running the job.
.It Sy Umask <integer>
This optional key specifies what value should be passed to
.Xr umask 2
before running the job.
.It Sy ServiceIPC <boolean>
This optional key specifies whether the job participates in advanced communication with
.Nm launchd .
The default is true.
.It Sy Sockets <dictionary of dictionaries...>
This optional key is used to specify launch on demand sockets that can be used to let
.Nm launchd
know when to run the job. The job can check-in and get a copy of the file descriptors using APIs outlined in
.Xr launch 3 .
The paramters below are used as inputs to call
.Xr getaddrinfo 3 .
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Sy SockType <string>
This optional key tells
.Nm launchctl
what type of socket to create. The default is "stream" and other valid values for this key
are "dgram" and "seqpacket" respectively.
.It Sy SockPassive <boolean>
This optional key specifies whether
.Xr listen 2
or
.Xr connect 2
should be called on the created file descriptor. The default is true ("to listen").
.It Sy SockNodeName <string>
This optional key specifies the node to
.Xr connect 2
or
.Xr bind 2
to.
.It Sy SockServiceName <string>
This optional key specifies the service on the node to
.Xr connect 2
or
.Xr bind 2
to.
.It Sy SockFamily <string>
This optional key can be used to specifically request that "IPv4" or "IPv6" socket(s) be created.
.It Sy SockProtocol <string>
This optional key specifies the protocol to be passed to
.Xr socket 2 .
The only value understood by this key at the moment is "TCP".
