{"name":"Open Launchd","tagline":"Porting launchd to open source unixes","body":"# Open Launchd\r\n\r\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger introduced a new program called `launchd`. The daemon\r\nreplaced `SystemStarter` (MacOS legacy) and older `rc.d` (BSD legacy) startup\r\nprocesses and job management functionality.\r\n\r\nLaunchd can be split into two logical pieces, \"process 1\", i.e. the root\r\nlaunchd which controls system startup and system daemons and \"user launchd\"\r\nwhich allows invividual users to manage their own processes/jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to port `launchd` in its entirety over to\r\nFreeBSD, hopefully making it usable by other BSD or Linux systems along the\r\nway. That said, the primary motivator for the original porting work in 2005 was\r\nto improve boot time. While improved boot time would be of tangible benefit to\r\nFreeBSD users, the current motivator of this project is to enable **modern\r\nprocess management for user and system level processes** on FreeBSD systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting involved:\r\n\r\n * `#openlaunchd` on the [Freenode](http://freenode.net) is where development\r\n   discussion can occur.\r\n * [open launchd](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openlaunchd) mailing\r\n   list\r\n\r\n\r\n### Helpful links\r\n\r\n * The main project [home page](https://wiki.freebsd.org/launchd) can be found\r\n   on the FreeBSD [project wiki](https://wiki.freebsd.org/).\r\n * `rwatson@` runs [fxr.watson.org](http://fxr.watson.org/) which can be very\r\n   useful for cross-referencing Apple system headers and code, with FreeBSD system\r\n   headers and code\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
